;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains an implementation of the jupiter algorithm,
;; which ensures the synchronization of data shared between multiple
;; peers despite differences in network latency.
;;
;; This implementation is partly based on the implementation used in
;; the obby library <http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/>. Note, however, that
;; the details of the implementations differ.
