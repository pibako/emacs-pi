* REQUIREMENTS

  Rudel is developed and tested only with GNU Emacs and therefore
  unlikely to run on other Emacs variants like XEmacs.

  To use Rudel, the following software is required:

** GNU Emacs 22 or above
   Rudel should work with recent versions of GNU Emacs starting from
   version 22. Older versions of GNU Emacs or XEmacs may or not work
   but are not actively tested.

** Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools (CEDET)
   Cedet contains the object system Eieio, which is used in Rudel's
   object-oriented implementation. Cedet can be obtained from
   http://cedet.sourceforge.net/

   IMPORTANT: It is necessary to use at least the 1.0pre6 version of
   CEDET since it fixes a serious problem in the object system Eieio.

   As of October 2009, Eieio is included in GNU Emacs. If you are
   using a version built since then, you do not have to install it
   yourself.

** GnuTLS (optional)
   Connections to Gobby servers require the gnutls-cli program.

** Avahi (optional)
   The Avahi daemon (http://avahi.org) is required for automatic
   session discovery and advertising.

   A version of GNU Emacs with Zeroconf support (GNU Emacs 23 or
   above) is required to talk to the Avahi daemon.

* INSTALLING

  To install Rudel, download a released version or the current
  development version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/rudel/ and
  place the code in any directory you like.

  Once Eieio (see CEDET in the REQUIREMENTS section above) is
  installed, add the following to your personal Emacs configuration:

  (load-file "/PATH/TO/RUDEL/rudel-loaddefs.el")

  This will set Rudel up to be loaded on demand when one of the
  commands `rudel-join-session', `rudel-host-session' or
  `global-rudel-minor-mode' is invoked.

* COMPILING

  In order to achieve better performance, Emacs can byte-compile the
  Rudel code. This can be done by opening rudel-compile.el in Emacs
  and invoking M-x eval-buffer.
