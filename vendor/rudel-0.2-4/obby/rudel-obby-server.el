;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains the server part of the obby backend for Rudel.
;;
;; It is implemented using one state machine (class
;; `rudel-obby-client') for each client connection. These state
;; machines have the following states:
;;
;; + new                  `rudel-obby-server-state-new'
;; + encryption-negotiate `rudel-obby-server-state-encryption-negotiate'
;; + before-join          `rudel-obby-server-state-before-join'
;; + idle                 `rudel-obby-server-state-idle'
