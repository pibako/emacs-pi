The first parameter, REPORTER, should be the result of a call to
`make-progress-reporter'. For reporters for which the max value
is known, the second argument determines the actual progress of
operation; it must be between MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE as passed
to `make-progress-reporter'.

However, if the change since last echo area update is too small
or not enough time has passed, then do nothing (see
`make-progress-reporter' for details).

In this case, this function is very inexpensive, you need not
care how often you call it."

MESSAGE is shown in the echo area.  When at least 1% of operation
is complete, the exact percentage will be appended to the
MESSAGE.  When you call `progress-reporter-done', word \"done\"
is printed after the MESSAGE.  You can change MESSAGE of an
existing progress reporter with `progress-reporter-force-update'.

If provided, MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE designate starting (0%
complete) and final (100% complete) states of operation.  The
latter should be larger; if this is not the case, then simply
negate all values.  Optional CURRENT-VALUE specifies the progress
by the moment you call this function.  You should omit it or set
it to nil in most cases since it defaults to MIN-VALUE.

Optional MIN-CHANGE determines the minimal change in percents to
report (default is 1%.)  Optional MIN-TIME specifies the minimal
time before echo area updates (default is 0.2 seconds.)  If
`float-time' function is not present, then time is not tracked
at all.  If OS is not capable of measuring fractions of seconds,
then this parameter is effectively rounded up.

If MIN-VALUE and MAX-VALUE are unknown, they may be omitted to
return a \"pulsing\" progress reporter."
